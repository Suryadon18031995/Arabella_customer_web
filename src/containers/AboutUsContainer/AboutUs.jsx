                          fresh and best product from around the world while experiencing savings from our streamlined
                          supply chain. Because of this, we offer flowers for a longer period of time at a better price,
                          all while helping farmers do better for their communities. Currently, our marketplace offers
                          flowers from Holland, locations across North and South America, Ethiopia, Kenya, Thailand, and
                          Vietnam, based on seasonal demands.</p><p> Our supply chain uses traditional transportation
                          channels, including temperature-controlled airfreight and refrigerated trucks, as well as
                          cutting edge small package delivery services using a cold-chain service through the morning
                          of delivery.  These methods cut up to 80% of travel time from the farms to the florists,
                          taking an average of two days instead of the typical ten.</p><p> Currently, we only sell to

                        <p>Environmental and social welfare are very important causes to us. Too often flower farms are uncertified,
                        putting their employeesâ€™ safety and well-being at risk while damaging the environment and product while not
                        using ecological materials. Because these issues are all too rampant in the industry, we have developed the
                        Sustainable Floral Fund. Aiming to achieve complete sustainability in our partner farms by 2020, we hope to
                        positively influence the floral industry by implementing more environmentally-friendly and socially-conscious
                        practices to protect the welfare of the farms and their employees. We are working hard to develop ways to
                        improve for everyoneâ€™s benefit as well as looking after the well-being of our planet.</p>
